## Heidi_Stiles_GDES5342

I'm Heidi, and I'm a graphic design student in my senior year. Currently, I'm working at Red Hen Press, an independent nonprofit press based in Los Angeles. My work there mostly involves designing book covers, but I've also gotten to do other behind-the-scenes work like adding edits to production files and doing preflights. I would love to continue doing this type of work in the future, ideally for pay, however it seems that the market for design jobs in general isn't great right now, much less in the book publishing industry, so I'm trying to develop my skills in as many areas as I can.

Outside of work and school, I love art, books, and gaming. As an artist, I mostly do sketches of characters, whether of my own invention or fanart of various media. For books, I've been trying to get back into reading after falling off during high school, and I've been decently successful, though we'll see how long that lasts now that I'm back in school. So far this year I've read 14 books. A few highlights have been:

* _Smoke Gets in Your Eyes_ by Caitlin Doughty  
   A nonfiction book about the author's experience working in the funeral industry and with death more generally
* _Into the Wild_ by Jon Krakauer  
   A biography of the infamous Chris McCandless and his ill-fated eponymous journey into the wild
* _Axiom's End_ by Lindsay Ellis  
   A soft science-fiction novel about first contact with an emphasis on culture, language, and relationships
* _Gilded Serpent_ by Danielle L. Jensen  
   An absolute brick of a young adult fantasy novel combining the four perspective characters from the previous two books

Currently, I'm focusing on rereading _Girl, Serpent, Thorn_ by Melissa Bashardoust, which is a young adult fantasy novel loosely based on _Sleeping Beauty_, but with a Persian-inspired setting and mythology and one of my favorite sapphic romances I've come across as of yet (and her other book has another one).

For gaming, while I do play video games, I wouldn't call myself a gamer in the typical meaning of the word since I don't play that much, both in terms of time and variety. To make up for it, I also play board games and TTRPGs. Now that the school year's started, I have less time for gaming, but I do still squeeze in weekly-ish or so sessions with the DND group I'm in and occasionally keep chipping away at the final act of my main campaign in _Baldur's Gate 3_.
